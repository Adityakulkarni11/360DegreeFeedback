               <P>360 Degree Feedback system for College.<br>
               A 360-degree feedback system is a comprehensive performance evaluation tool where employees receive confidential, 
               anonymous feedback from the people who work around them. This typically includes Students, Faculty, HOD, Principal, Management, and sometimes, Non Teaching Staff. 
               The goal is to provide a well-rounded perspective on an individual's performance, highlighting strengths and identifying areas for development. 
               Feedback is usually gathered through structured questionnaires and is used for professional growth rather than for administrative decisions like promotions or salary increases. 
               This holistic approach fosters open communication, enhances self-awareness, and contributes to the overall improvement of individual and organizational performance.
